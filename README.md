# IMPORTANT: Meteorchef deprecated Base in June 2017 and so this should also be deprecated. Instead please go directly to their new project, [Pup](https://github.com/cleverbeagle/pup), run by their new organization Clever Beagle. This is a GOOD thing.

# Base + FCC
A starting point for building FreeCodeCamp projects with Meteor. Because Meteor is awesome and is a perfect fit for FCC-size projects. Forked from [gstephen's MeteorChef/Base Restricted Access Branch at v4.10.0](https://github.com/rgstephens/base/tree/extendDoc)

# (Old) Features I took from gstephen's Branch

This extension to [Meteor Base](http://themeteorchef.com/base) adds an ownerId field to the Documents collection and restricts document access to the owner. It also adds fields to the document to track create & modify date.

# (New) Features Added in This Fork

- Twitter login
- Unauthenticated view of all documents (without Editing ability although the API may be hackable)
- My Documents page

# Beginners: I'm New To Meteor, How To Get This Running On Local?

borrowing heavily from <https://themeteorchef.com/base/getting-started> (go ahead and read the whole thing if you have time):

0. open up your terminal and go to your favorite webdev terminal
1. `git clone https://github.com/sw-yx/base-fcc.git base-fcc` (replace "base-fcc" with whatever name you want)
2. `cd base-fcc` and then `meteor npm install`
3. `meteor npm start`
4. once the app has compiled, open `localhost:3000` in your browser

# Tips for Deploying to Heroku

Just check this out :) <https://medium.com/@leonardykris/how-to-run-a-meteor-js-application-on-heroku-in-10-steps-7aceb12de234#.nmyq8xpf7> 
except note that the buildpack he recommends is old and you should use <https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse>
also you should grep a slightly different mongodb uri `heroku config | grep MONGODB_URI`
